**TL;DR :** I discovered a broken access control vulnerability in UCY's alumni system web app that allowed me to change other users' passwords.

## Cyber Yankee 2024
- In May 2024 I particpate in the [Cyber Yankee exercise](https://www.dvidshub.net/image/8396710/massachusetts-national-guard-hosts-cyber-yankee-2024) at Joint Base Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA.

- Cyber Yankee is a regionally focused exercise evaluating a whole-of-government **response to a significant cyber incident** involving <u>critical infrastructure and key resources</u>. 
- The exercise includes participants from across military, local, state, and federal government, as well as members working with the [State Partnership Program](https://www.nationalguard.mil/Leadership/Joint-Staff/J-5/International-Affairs-Division/State-Partnership-Program/).
- Cyber Yankee took place over **two weeks**, with the first week dedicated to **training** and the second week focused on the **actual exercise**.

## BootUp CTF
- During the first week, a CTF competition called `bootUp CTF`, organised by [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) where held. Any participant could join and play during their free time.
- My team finished second ðŸ¥ˆ, but I **scored the most points** as an individual and was awarded a SANS coin.
