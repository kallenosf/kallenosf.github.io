**TL;DR :** I discovered a broken access control vulnerability in UCY's alumni system web app that allowed me to change other users' passwords.

## Observation
- In June 2024 I graduated (ðŸŽ‰) from the Computer Science Department of University of Cyprus, and so I joined the UCY's alumni system web app.
- When I registering my account, I couldn't choose my own password but a cleartext password was sent to me via email (ðŸ¤”).
- Therefore I was really courious about the security level of the whole app, and was curious if I could find any critical bugs.

## Identifying a vulnerability
- I noticed that the app has a reset password functionality.
- I tried resetting my own password q
